Objective

The goal of this SQL analysis was to prepare, clean, and analyze manufacturing data efficiently, enabling the creation of a robust and insightful dashboard. SQL was used to extract, transform, and structure the data, ensuring consistency and readiness for visualization in Tableau and Power BI.

SQL Techniques Used

Data Extraction and Selection:

Utilized SELECT statements to retrieve specific columns and filter relevant data.

Applied ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses to sort and sample the dataset.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Used ALTER TABLE to change column data types, ensuring consistency and accuracy in calculations.

Standardized date formats and aligned data types across tables.

Replaced missing values and non-existing dimensions with 'Unknown' to maintain data integrity.

Aggregations and Grouping:

Applied GROUP BY to segment data by parameters like Buyer Name, Machine Name, and Employee Name.

Used aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM(), and AVG() to calculate key metrics.

Common Table Expressions (CTE):

Created temporary result sets using WITH clauses for more readable and organized queries.

Simplified complex queries by breaking them down into manageable parts.

Simplified Joins:

Used basic joins when necessary, but avoided complex multi-join queries to maintain efficiency and simplicity.

Key Metrics Calculated

Lead Time: Difference between Sales Order Document Date and Expected Delivery Date.

Delay Time: Difference between Expected Delivery Date and Sales Order Delivery Date.

Month-on-Month Order Volume: Aggregated order counts per month.

Rejection Rates: Percentage of rejected items by buyer and machine.

Insights from SQL Analysis

Operational Efficiency: Identified opportunities to reduce lead time by 10% through better production scheduling.

Quality Control: Highlighted areas with high rejection rates, suggesting focused training and quality checks.

Data Quality: Emphasized the need for a better data entry system to avoid missing and inconsistent values.

Conclusion

SQL played a crucial role in cleaning, transforming, and analyzing manufacturing data, laying a strong foundation for creating accurate and insightful dashboards. By using fundamental SQL operations like CRUD, grouping, CTEs, and data type alterations, we ensured efficient data handling and meaningful analysis.
